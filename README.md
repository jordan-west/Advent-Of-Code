# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) event.

## Running code samples

Each solution folder contains a Makefile to compile and link a C++ program with the g++ compiler.

Example: 

```bash
# Enter a solution directory.
cd 2017/01_Inverse_Captcha

# Compile and link the solution.
make

# Run the solution
./solution
```
